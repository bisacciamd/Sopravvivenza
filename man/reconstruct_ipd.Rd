\description{
This function implements the algorithm described by Guyot et al. to reconstruct
individual patient data (IPD) from digitized Kaplan-Meier curves.

# Basic usage

)

# With number at risk data
result <- reconstruct_ipd(
  time_points = c(0, 6, 12, 18, 24),
  surv_probs = c(1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6),

  risk_times = c(0, 12, 24),
